#Clojure Presentation

This is a presentation about functional programming and Clojure in particular.

I implement a tic-tac-toe player to demonstrate some cool Clojure features and
to show how do you model a simple problem the functional way.

You can see the presentation online in (http://paraseba.github.com/clojure-tic-tac-toe-presentation/)

To see the full code for the tic-tac-toe, go to (https://github.com/paraseba/tictactoe)
