#Clojure Presentation

This is a presentation about functional programming and Clojure in particular.

I use tic-tac-toe to showoff some cool Clojure features and how do you model
a simple problem the functional way.

You can see the presentation online in (https://paraseba.github.com/clojure-tic-tac-toe-presentation)

To see the full code for the tic-tac-toe, go to (https://github.com/paraseba/tictactoe)
